# DESCRIPTION : Project Title: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Using NLP

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model to classify Amazon product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to gain insights into customer feedback and automate the sentiment classification process, which can help businesses understand consumer opinions at scale.

I started by collecting a dataset of Amazon reviews, which included review text and corresponding ratings. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of sentiments and identify common keywords and patterns. This step helped me uncover insights such as frequently used positive or negative words, the average review length, and the relationship between star ratings and sentiment.

I concluded the project by visualizing the most frequent positive and negative words using word clouds and bar plots, providing valuable insights for product teams. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation in NLP. It demonstrated how sentiment analysis can transform unstructured textual data into actionable business intelligence.
